    "In this project, we will be acquainting ourselves with the remarkable dataset, \"Productivity Prediction of Garment Employees,\" which offers valuable insights into the garment industry's productivity performance. This dataset is a valuable resource, sourced from the prestigious [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Productivity+Prediction+of+Garment+Employees), renowned for its high-quality datasets. Below is a description of the dataset, according to its official summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"*The garment industry is one of the key examples of the industrial globalization of the modern era.\n",
    "It is a highly labour-intensive industry with lots of manual processes. Satisfying the huge global demand for garment products is mostly dependent on the production and delivery performance of the employees in the garment manufacturing companies.\n",
    "So, it is highly desirable among the decision-makers in the garments industry to track, analyze, and predict the productivity performance of the working teams in their factories.*\"\n",
    "\n",

    "  Source: <a href=\"https://www.dataquest.io/\">DataQuest</a>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes this dataset particularly fascinating is its versatility, as it can be utilized with both regression and classification algorithms, as stated in the official summary's final sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"*This dataset can be used for regression purposes by predicting the productivity range (0-1) or for classification purposes by transforming the productivity range (0-1) into different classes.*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "While this dataset's versatility allows us to analyze it using a variety of different methods and techniques, in this project, we will be concentrating on utilizing a classification tree. By focusing on this method, we aim to gain valuable insights into the productivity performance of garment employees and improve our understanding of the garment industry's manufacturing processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Import Libraries and Load Data\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, we will import the necessary libraries and load the \"Productivity Prediction of Garment Employees\" dataset into a DataFrame, enabling us to manipulate and analyze the data effectively."

    "\n",
    "- `date`: date in MM-DD-YYYY\n",
    "- `quarter`: a portion of the month — month was divided into four quarters\n",
    "- `department`: associated department with the instance\n",
    "- `day`: day of the week\n",
    "- `team`: associated team number with the instance\n",
    "- `targeted_productivity`: targeted productivity set by the authority for each team for each day\n",
    "- `smv`: standard minute value — the allocated time for a task\n",
    "- `wip`: work in progress — includes the number of unfinished items for products\n",
    "- `over_time`: represents the amount of overtime by each team in minutes\n",
    "- `incentive`: represents the amount of financial incentive (in BDT) that enables or motivates a particular course of action\n",
    "- `idle_time`: the duration of time when the production was interrupted due to several reasons\n",
    "- `idle_men`: the number of workers who were idle due to production interruption\n",
    "- `no_of_style_change`: number of changes in the style of a particular product\n",
    "- `no_of_workers`: number of workers on each team\n",
    "- `actual_productivity`: the actual % of productivity that was delivered by the workers — it ranges from 0 to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our next steps, we will explore the columns in the `df` dataset. First, we will identify the type of data included in each column and check for missing or incorrect values. To get a better understanding of each column's distribution, we will calculate the count of observations for each unique value. Then, we will compare relevant columns with each other, such as `targeted_productivity` vs. `actual_productivity`. By analyzing the relationships between these columns, we can gain insights into how the actual productivity relates to the targeted productivity and make data-driven decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, let's obtain the shape of the dataset, where the first value represents the number of observations, and the second value represents the number of columns."

    "- `targeted_productivity`: The mean targeted productivity is 0.73, with a minimum of 0.07 and a maximum of 0.8.\n",

    "- `wip`: The average work in progress is 1190.47, with a minimum of 7 and a maximum of 23122.\n",
    "- `over_time`: The average overtime is 4567.46, with a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 25920.\n",
    "- `incentive`: The average incentive is 38.21, with a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 3600.\n",
    "- `idle_time`: The average idle time is 0.73, with a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 300.\n",
    "- `idle_men`: The average number of idle men is 0.37, with a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 45.\n",
    "- `no_of_style_change`: The average number of style changes is 0.15, with a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 2.\n",
    "- `no_of_workers`: The average number of workers is 34.61, with a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 89.\n",
    "- `actual_productivity`: The average actual productivity is 0.74, with a minimum of 0.23 and a maximum of 1.12.\n",
    "\n",
    "By examining the table, we can discover several interesting facts about the dataset. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are missing values in the `wip` column, as the count for that column is only 691 instead of 1197.\n",
    "- There are some columns such as `wip`, `over_time`, `incentive`, `idle_time`, `idle_men`, and `no_of_workers` with a maximum value that is much higher than the 75th percentile, indicating the presence of outliers in the dataset.\n",
    "- The range of values for each column varies widely, indicating the need for scaling or normalization as we plan to use these features to build our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that the targeted productivity has a relatively small range, suggesting that there may be strict targets for productivity that the factory is trying to meet. The average overtime is quite high, which may indicate that the factory is having trouble meeting its production targets within regular working hours. The number of workers ranges from 2 to 89, suggesting that there may be some variability in the workforce size depending on production needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The statistics related to idle time and idle men are particularly interesting, as they suggest that there may be some issues with productivity in the factory. The fact that the average idle time is relatively low, but there is still a maximum of 300 minutes of idle time, suggests that there may be some production stoppages or other issues that are causing lost time. Similarly, the fact that there is a maximum of 45 idle men suggests that there may be some inefficiencies in the workforce or production process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far, we have analyzed the relationships between columns in our dataset. However, we must now take a closer look at each column independently. Our first step is to determine the data type included in each column and check for any missing or incorrect values. After identifying and addressing any issues, we will compute the count of observations for each unique value to gain a better understanding of the distribution of each column. Additionally, we will compare relevant columns, such as targeted_productivity vs. actual_productivity, to explore how the actual productivity relates to the targeted productivity. By examining these relationships, we can gather valuable insights and make data-driven decisions.\n",

This will help us to analyze how the performance metrics in the dataset vary across different months. By doing this, we may be able to identify patterns or trends in the data that can help us to make more informed decisions. For example, we may observe that productivity is consistently higher on certain days of the week, or that there is a seasonal pattern in the data. This information could be used to improve operations and increase efficiency."

    "\n",
    "- `over_time`: The highest frequency is in the range of (-25.921000000000003, 1296.0] with 252 counts, which means that most of the workers have worked overtime for up to 1296 minutes. The other ranges show lower frequencies, indicating that there were fewer workers who worked overtime for longer durations. The last six ranges have no counts, suggesting that none of the workers worked overtime for durations beyond those ranges.\n",
    "- `smv`: The highest frequency is in the range of (2.847, 5.483] with 506 counts, which means that most of the workers had an SMV score in this range. The other ranges show lower frequencies, indicating that there were fewer workers with SMV scores outside this range. The last two ranges have no counts, suggesting that none of the workers had an SMV score outside those ranges.\n",
    "- `incentive`: The majority of the data falls in the range of -3.601 to 180, with a total of 1187 observations, indicating that most incentives are small in value. There are only a few observations above this range, indicating that high-value incentives are relatively rare in the data.\n",
    "- `targeted_productivity`: The highest frequency is in the range of (0.764, 0.8] with 540 counts, which means that most of the workers achieved a targeted productivity score within this range. The other ranges show lower frequencies, indicating that there were fewer workers who achieved productivity scores outside this range. The last two ranges have no counts, suggesting that none of the workers achieved productivity scores outside those ranges.\n",
