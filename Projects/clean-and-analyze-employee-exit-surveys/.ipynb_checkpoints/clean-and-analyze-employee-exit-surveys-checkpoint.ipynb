    "# Employee Exit Surveys\n",
    "\n",
    "## Backgroud\n",
    "\n",
    "Staff feedback provides the companies with valuable information on the reasons why employees resign or retire. This information is used to inform attraction and retention initiatives and to improve work practices across the any company to ensure the company is considered an employer of choice.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Project and Data Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we'll work with exit surveys from employees of the [Department of Education, Training and Employment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_and_Training_(Queensland)) (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institude in Queensland, Australia.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DETE Exit Survey was developed to effectively canvas the opinions and attitudes of departing employees to identify a wide range of operational, organizational and personal variables affecting the decision to leave.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can find the DETE exit survey data [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey). However, the orignial TAFE exit survey data is no longer available.\n",
    "Therefore, we'll be using the modified versions of the original datasets to make them easier to work with, which includes changing the encoding to `UTF-8` (the original ones are encoded using `cp1252`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "The data dictionary wasn't provided with the datasets. Therefore, we'll use our general knowledge to define the columns used in them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a preview of a couple columns we'll work with from the `dete_survey.csv`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ID`: An id used to identify the participant of the survey\n",
    "- `SeparationType`: The reason why the person's employment ended\n",
    "- `Cease Date`: The year or month the person's employment ended\n",
    "- `DETE Start Date`: The year the person began employment with the DETE\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a preview of a couple columns we'll work with from the `tafe_survey.csv`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Record ID`: An id used to identify the participant of the survey\n",
    "- `Reason for ceasing employment`: The reason why the person's employment ended\n",
    "- `LengthofServiceOverall. Overall Length of Service at Institute (in years)`: The length of the person's employment (in years)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we'll analyze these datasets (DETE & TAFE) to find out the answers of the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are employees who only worked for the institues for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?\n",
    "- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll combine the resluts for *both* surveys to answer these questions. However, although both used the same survey template, one of them customized some of the answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importing Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by importing some useful libraries we need in the project."
