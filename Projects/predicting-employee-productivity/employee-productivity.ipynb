    "In this project, we will be acquainting ourselves with the remarkable dataset, \"Productivity Prediction of Garment Employees,\" which offers valuable insights into the garment industry's productivity performance. This dataset is a valuable resource, sourced from the prestigious [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Productivity+Prediction+of+Garment+Employees), renowned for its high-quality datasets. Below is a description of the dataset, according to its official summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"*The garment industry is one of the key examples of the industrial globalization of the modern era.\n",
    "It is a highly labour-intensive industry with lots of manual processes. Satisfying the huge global demand for garment products is mostly dependent on the production and delivery performance of the employees in the garment manufacturing companies.\n",
    "So, it is highly desirable among the decision-makers in the garments industry to track, analyze, and predict the productivity performance of the working teams in their factories.*\"\n",
    "\n",

    "  Source: <a href=\"https://www.dataquest.io/\">DataQuest</a>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes this dataset particularly fascinating is its versatility, as it can be utilized with both regression and classification algorithms, as stated in the official summary's final sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"*This dataset can be used for regression purposes by predicting the productivity range (0-1) or for classification purposes by transforming the productivity range (0-1) into different classes.*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "While this dataset's versatility allows us to analyze it using a variety of different methods and techniques, in this project, we will be concentrating on utilizing a classification tree. By focusing on this method, we aim to gain valuable insights into the productivity performance of garment employees and improve our understanding of the garment industry's manufacturing processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Import Libraries and Load Data\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, we will import the necessary libraries and load the \"Productivity Prediction of Garment Employees\" dataset into a DataFrame, enabling us to manipulate and analyze the data effectively."

    "- `team`: associated team number with the instance\n",
    "- `targeted_productivity`: targeted productivity set by the authority for each team for each day\n",
    "- `smv`: standard minute value — the allocated time for a task\n",
    "- `wip`: work in progress — includes the number of unfinished items for products\n",
    "- `over_time`: represents the amount of overtime by each team in minutes\n",
    "- `incentive`: represents the amount of financial incentive (in BDT) that enables or motivates a particular course of action\n",
    "- `idle_time`: the duration of time when the production was interrupted due to several reasons\n",
    "- `idle_men`: the number of workers who were idle due to production interruption\n",
    "- `no_of_style_change`: number of changes in the style of a particular product\n",

    "From the summary statistics table, we can observe the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `team`: The average team number is 6.4, with a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 12.\n",
    "- `targeted_productivity`: The mean targeted productivity is 0.73, with a minimum of 0.07 and a maximum of 0.8.\n",
    "- `smv`: The average standard minute value is 15.06, with a minimum of 2.9 and a maximum of 54.56.\n",
    "- `wip`: The average work in progress is 1190.47, with a minimum of 7 and a maximum of 23122.\n",
    "- `over_time`: The average overtime is 4567.46, with a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 25920.\n",
    "- `incentive`: The average incentive is 38.21, with a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 3600.\n",
    "- `idle_time`: The average idle time is 0.73, with a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 300.\n",
    "- `idle_men`: The average number of idle men is 0.37, with a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 45.\n",
    "- `no_of_style_change`: The average number of style changes is 0.15, with a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 2.\n",
    "- `no_of_workers`: The average number of workers is 34.61, with a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 89.\n",
    "- `actual_productivity`: The average actual productivity is 0.74, with a minimum of 0.23 and a maximum of 1.12.\n",
    "\n",
    "By examining the table, we can discover several interesting facts about the dataset. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are missing values in the `wip` column, as the count for that column is only 691 instead of 1197.\n",
    "- There are several columns with a maximum value that is much higher than the 75th percentile, indicating the presence of outliers in the dataset.\n",
    "- The range of values for each column varies widely, indicating the need for scaling or normalization as we plan to use these features to build our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that the targeted productivity has a relatively small range, suggesting that there may be strict targets for productivity that the factory is trying to meet. The average overtime is quite high, which may indicate that the factory is having trouble meeting its production targets within regular working hours. The number of workers ranges from 2 to 89, suggesting that there may be some variability in the workforce size depending on production needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The statistics related to idle time and idle men are particularly interesting, as they suggest that there may be some issues with productivity in the factory. The fact that the average idle time is relatively low, but there is still a maximum of 300 minutes of idle time, suggests that there may be some production stoppages or other issues that are causing lost time. Similarly, the fact that there is a maximum of 45 idle men suggests that there may be some inefficiencies in the workforce or production process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the summary statistics give us a high-level view of the data and can be used to identify potential areas for improvement or further investigation."
