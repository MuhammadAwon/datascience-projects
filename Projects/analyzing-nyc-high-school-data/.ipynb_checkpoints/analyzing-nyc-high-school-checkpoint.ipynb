    "# Analyzing NYC High School Data for Efficacy of Standardized Tests\n",

    "\n",
    "In this project, we'll be using data about New York City public schools, which can be found [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?category=Education).\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most controversial issues in the US educational system is the efficacy of standardized tests and whether they're unfair to certain groups. Given our prior knowledge of this topic, investigating the correlations between [SAT scores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT) and demographics might be an interesting angle to take. We could correlate SAT scores with factors like race, gender, income, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Test), is an exam that US high school students take before applying to college. Colleges take the test scores into account when deciding who to admit, so it's important to perform well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test consists of three sections, each of which has 800 possible points. The combined score is out of 2,400 possible (while this number has changed a few times, the dataset for our project is based on 2,400 total points). Organizations often rank high schools by their average SAT scores. The scores are also considered a measure of overall school district quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "New York City makes its [data on high school SAT scores](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4) available online, as well as the [demographic for each high school](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/DOE-High-School-Directory-2014-2015/n3p6-zve2). This first few rows of the SAT data look like this:\n",

    "*source*: [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/new-home/)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, combining both of the datasets won't give us all of the demographic information we want to use. We'll need to supplement our data with other sources to do our full analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same website has several related datasets covering demographic information and test scores. Here are the links to all of the datasets we'll be using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [SAT scores by school](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4) - SAT scores for each high school in New York City\n",
    "- [School attendance](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/School-Attendance-and-Enrollment-Statistics-by-Dis/7z8d-msnt) - Attendance information for each school in New York City\n",
    "- [Class size](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-2011-Class-Size-School-level-detail/urz7-pzb3) - Information on class size for each school\n",
    "- [AP test results](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/AP-College-Board-2010-School-Level-Results/itfs-ms3e) - Advanced Placement (AP) exam results for each high school (passing an optional AP exam in a particular subject can earn a student college credit in that subject)\n",
    "- [Graduation outcomes](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/Graduation-Outcomes-Classes-Of-2005-2010-School-Le/vh2h-md7a) - The percentage of students who graduated, and other outcome information\n",
    "- [Demographics](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/School-Demographics-and-Accountability-Snapshot-20/ihfw-zy9j) - Demographic information for each school\n",
    "- [School survey](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/NYC-School-Survey-2011/mnz3-dyi8) - Surveys of parents, teachers, and students at each school\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these datasets are interrelated. We'll need to combine them into a single dataset before we can find correlations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background Research on Topic\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we move into coding, we'll need to do a thorough research to understand the data. This can help us avoid costly mistakes, such as thinking that a column represents something other than what it does. Background research gives us a better understanding of how to combine and analyze the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we'll want to research:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City)\n",
    "- [The SAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT)\n",
    "- [Schools in New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_high_schools_in_New_York_City)\n",
    "- [Our data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?category=Education)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can learn a few different things from these resources, For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Only high school students take the SAT, so we'll want to focus on high schools.\n",
    "- New York City is made up of five boroughs, which are essentially distinct regions.\n",
    "- New York City schools fall within several different school districts, each of which can contain dozens of schools.\n",
    "- Our datasets include several different types of schools. We'll need to clean them so that we can focus on high schools only.\n",
    "- Each school in New York City has a unique code called a `DBN` or district borough number.\n",
    "- Aggregating data by district allows us to use the district mapping data to plot district-by-district differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Import Libraries and Read in Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "In our first step, we'll import the libraries that are useful to work with the datasets."

    "From looking at these rows, we can tell that the `DBN` in the `sat_results` data is just a combination of the `CSD` and `SCHOOL CODE` columns in the `class_size` data. The main difference is that the `DBN` is padded, so that the `CSD` portion of it always consists of two digits. That means we'll need to add a leading `0` to the `CSD` if the `CSD` is less than two digits long. Here's a diagram illustrating what we need to do:\n",

    "| 19 | 19 |\n",
    "| 2 | 02 |\n",
    "| 99 | 99 |\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, whenever the `CSD` is less than two digits long, we need to add a leading `0`. We can accomplish this using the [pandas.Series.apply()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.apply.html) method, along with a common function that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Takes in a number.\n",
    "- Converts the number to a string using the [str()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) function.\n",
    "- Checks the length of the string using the [len()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#len) function.\n",
    "    - If the string is two digits long, returns the string.\n",
    "    - If the string is one digit long, adds a `0` to the front of the string, then returns it.\n",
    "        - We can use the string method [zfill()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.zfill) to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've padded the `CSD`, we can use the addition operator (`+`) to combine the values in the `CSD` and `SCHOOL CODE` columns. Here's a diagram illustrating the basic concept:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Padded CSD |  | School Code |  | DBN |\n",
    "| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n",
    "| 01 |  | M015 |  | 01M015 |\n",

    "| 99 |  | M025 |  | 99M025 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Before manipulating data in the `class_size` dataframe, first we'll copy the `dbn` column in `hs_directory` into a new column called `DBN`."

A single row in the `sat_results` dataset may match multiple rows in the `clean_size` dataset, for example. This situation creates problems, because we don't know which of the multiple entries in the `clean_size` dataset we should combine with the single matchin entry in `sat_results`.

    "We're almost ready to combine all the datasets. The last thing to do is convert the [Advanced Placement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Placement_exams) (AP) test scores from strings to numeric values. High school students take the AP exams before applying to college. There are several AP exams, each corresponding to a school subject. High school students who earn high scores may receive college credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "AP exams have a `1` to `5` scale; `3` or higher is a passing score. Many high school students take AP exams -- particularly those who attend academically challenging institutions. AP exams are rarer in schools that lack funding or academic rigor.\n",

    "Before we merge our data, we'll need to decide on the merge strategy we want to use. We'll be using the pandas [pandas.DataFrame.merge()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.merge.html) function, which supports four types of joins -- `left`, `right`, `inner`, and `outer`. Each of these join types dictates how pandas combines the rows.\n",

    "There may be `DBN` values that exist in one dataset but not in another. This is partly because the data is from different years. Each dataset also has inconsistencies in terms of how it was gathered. Human error (and other types of errors) may also play a role. Therefore, we may not find matches for the `DBN` values in `sat_results` in all of the other datasets and other datasets may have `DBN` values that don't exist in `sat_results`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll merge two datasets at a time. For example, we'll merge `sat_results` and `hs_directory`, then merge the result with `ap_2010`, then merge the result of that with `class_size`. We'll continue combining datasets in this way until we've merged all of them. Afterwards, we'll have roughly the same number of rows, but each row has columns from all of the datasets.\n",
