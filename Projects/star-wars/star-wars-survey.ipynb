    "While waiting for the movie to arrive: *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*, the team at [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/) became interested in the survey about *Star Wars* fans. In particular, they wondered: **does the rest of America realize that \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is clearly the best of the bunch?**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The team used the online tool SurveyMonkey to collect the data from *Star War* fans. They received 835 total responses, which are available on [their GitHub repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey)."

    "- `Age` - the respondent's age\n",
    "- `Household Income` - the respondent's income\n",
    "- `Education` - the respondent's eduction level\n",
    "- `Location (Census Region)` - the respondent's location\n",
    "- `Have you seen any of the 6 films in the Star Wars franchise` - a `Yes` or `No` respone\n",
    "- `Do you consider yourself to be a fan of the Star Wars film franchise` - a `Yes` or `No` response\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several other columns containing answers to questions aobut the *Star Wars* movies. For some questions, the respondent had to check one or more boxes. This type of data is difficult to represent in a column. As a result, this dataset needs a lot of cleaning."
